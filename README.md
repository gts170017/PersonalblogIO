My First Blog
Welcome to the repository of my very first blog project! This project is a simple but fully functional blog platform where users can post their thoughts, read what others have written, and even delete their own posts. The front end is crafted with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, making it a straightforward yet engaging web application.

Features
User-friendly Posting Interface: Users can easily share their thoughts by filling out a form that includes their username, post title, and content.
Dynamic Content Rendering: The blog dynamically renders posts stored in the browser's localStorage, making it a seamless experience to see the latest posts without needing a page reload.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Enhancing user experience with the ability to switch between light and dark modes for comfortable reading, regardless of the time of day.
Immediate Feedback: After submitting a post, users are redirected to the blog page to see their contributions live.
Interactive Post Management: Users can delete their posts, ensuring control over the content they choose to share.
Project Structure
index.html and blog.html: The two main HTML pages for the project.
style.css, form.css, and blog.css: CSS files that respectively style the overall app, the form page, and the blog page.
form.js and blog.js: JavaScript files handling the form functionalities and the blog post rendering, respectively.
logic.js: Contains the logic for the light/dark mode toggle feature.
Development Journey
Developing this blog was a hands-on learning experience where I prioritized getting a working build over maintaining a detailed commit history. In the excitement and focus of bringing this project to life from scratch, I overlooked the importance of version control. This approach allowed me to fully immerse myself in the development process, tackling challenges and implementing features with undivided attention.

However, I recognize the value of commit history for tracking progress, understanding development stages, and facilitating collaboration. It's a lesson learned for future projects, where I will ensure to balance the focus on development with good version control practices.

Acknowledgments
This project wouldn't have been possible without the numerous resources available for beginner developers, the supportive coding community, and feedback from peers. Special thanks to everyone who contributed their time and knowledge to help shape this project.
